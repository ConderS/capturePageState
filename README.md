# Standardized Screenshot

Very opinionated screenshot capture extension for Google Chrome.

It will:

- Resize the browser window to be 1280px wide.
- Capture the current tab.
- Add a OS X-ish title bar.
- Add drop shadow to it.
- Display the result in a new tab.
- Resize the browser window to the original size.
